# Entropy
Entropy Client for steam, using the [SteamKit](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit) API wrapper.
The goal of Entropy is to help choose what game to play when you really have no idea. (Assuming that game is on steam, sorry league fans!)


# TODO

* Add a better way to handle logging in than passing username and password as 
* Randomly select a game to play, and launch that game.
* Compare owned games between yourself and another user on steam, based on certain categories, such as co-op.
* Create a better interface, either through a web based GUI or a winforms type app.
